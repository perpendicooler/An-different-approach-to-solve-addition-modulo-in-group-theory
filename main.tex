\section*{Abstract}

This paper explores the generalisation form of an element's order in a group under the addition modulo.We looked for an alternative approach to determine the order of an element within a group. We displayed the spiral-shaped graph to show how things are progressing. To prove that our alternate method is identical to the established approach , we have provided entire code.
\section{Introduction}

In mathematics, more specifically algebra, abstract algebra or modern algebra is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras over a field. The term abstract algebra was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from older parts of algebra, and more specifically from elementary algebra, the use of variables to represent numbers in computation and reasoning.\cite{finston2014abstract}
\subsection{Group}
\subsubsection{Definition}
Let $G$ be a set together with a binary operation (usually called multiplication) that assigns to each ordered pair $(a, b)$ of elements of $G$ an element in $G$ denoted by $ab$.\\ We say G is a group under this operation if the following four properties are satisfied.\\
1.Closure: If $a$ and $b$ are two components in the group, $G$, then the product “$a * b$” is also in “$G$”.\\
2. Associativity: The operation is associative; that is, $(ab)c = a(bc)$ for
all $a, b, c$ in $G$.\\
3. Identity: There is an element e (called the identity) in $G$ such that
$ae = ea = a$ for all $a$ in $G$.\\
4. Inverses: For each element a in $G$, there is an element $b$ in $G$ (called
an inverse of $a$) such that $ab = ba = e$.\cite{gallian2021contemporary}




\subsection{Order of an element in a group}
\subsubsection{Definition}
The order of an element g in a group G is the smallest positive integer n
such that ($g^n$) = $e$. (In additive notation, this would be $ng$ = 0.) If no such
integer exists, we say that g has infinite order. The order of an element $g$
is denoted by $|g|$.\\
So, to find the order of a group element g, you need only compute the
sequence of products g, ($g^2$), ($g^3$) . . .  until you reach the identity for the first time. The exponent of this product (or coefficient if the operation is addition) is the order of g. If the identity never appears in the sequence, then
g has infinite order.\cite{gallian2021contemporary}
\subsection{Addition Modulo}
\subsubsection{Definition}
The word ‘modulo’ means ‘to the modulus’. For any positive integer $n$, let $S$ be the complete set of residues \{$0$, $1$, $2$,…, $n-1$\}. Then addition modulo $n$ on $S$ is defined as follows. For $a$ and $b$ in $S$, take the usual sum of $a$ and $b$ as integers, and let $r$ be the element of $S$ to which the result is congruent (modulo $n$); the sum $a+b$ (mod $n$) is equal to $r$. Similarly, multiplication modulo $n$ is defined by taking$ ab$ (mod $n$) to be equal to $s$, where $s$ is the element of $S$ to which the usual product of $a$ and $b$ is congruent (modulo $n$).\cite{clapham2014concise}
\subsection{L.C.M}
\subsubsection{Definition}
In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers$ a $and $ b$, usually denoted by $lcm(a, b)$, is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if $a$ and $b$ are both different from zero. However, some authors define $lcm(a,0)$ as $0$ for all $a$, since $0$ is the only common multiple of $a$ and $0$ .\cite{hardy1979introduction}

\section{Method of Solving the problem}
For example,This is the conventional way to  \\
Consider $Z_{10}$ under addition modulo $10$. 
we know the residue class of $Z_{10}$ is $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$
Since $1 * 2 = 2$,
$2 * 2 = 4, 3 * 2 = 6, 4 * 2 = 8, 5 * 2 = 0$, we know that $|2| = 5$. \\
Similar computations  $|0| = 1, |7| = 10, |5| = 2, |6| = 5$.\\ (Here $2 * 2$ is an
abbreviation for $2 + 2, 3 * 2 $ is an abbreviation for $2 + 2 + 2$, etc.)\cite{gallian2021contemporary}\\\\
We can generate any modulo $Z n$ in a wheel setup to see how modular arithmetic works.We can pick any whole number $a$ in $Z_{10}$ to see which residue class it belongs.suppose we take $157$ so, $157 \equiv 7 mod (10)$ we can see its on the $[7] $ residue class.because we can derive $157 = 15*10 + 7$ which $10n+7$ which lied on the residue class $[7]$.In a wheel setup of modular arithmetic it its more easy to see the residue class of any number a. \\\\

It's similar to a modulo $Z_{10}$ wheel setup.We can see all of the residue classes here$Z_{10}$=$\{[0],[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9]\}$\\\\
In this case, $[0]$ represents the identity for the order of an element in a group under addition modulo.\\
And We know The order of an element g in a group G is the smallest positive integer n
such that ($g^n$) = $e$.\\
Here We need to start from $[0]$ to find the order of every element of this group.\\\\
So,The $0$ is already in the $[0]$ class and so the order of $0$ is 1\\\\
$ |0| = 1 $\\\\
For the element $1$ It will proceed to the residue class after exactly ten steps.\\\

The steps will be counted as follows: 0 to 9 , 9 to 18 , 18 to 27 and so on.After exactly 10 bend arrows it moved to its identity element..the least amount of steps to be on residue class $[9]$ is $10$.Also in other words, \\
the order of $9$ is $10$\\\\

$ |9| = 10 $\\\\
We can clearly see a pattern here, A element takes the fewest steps to travel residue class $[0]$ is the order of that element.in residue class $[0]$=\{10 , 20, 30 , 40 , 50 , 60  ...$10*n$\} where n $\geq$0 and $n \in N$ which is the element's common multiple, and $Z_n$\\\\
As a result, the shortest step is and the element in n $\geq$ 0\\\\
$|1|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (1,10)}{1} ={\frac{10}{1}} = 10$\\\\
$|2|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (2,10)}{2} ={\frac{10}{2}} =5$\\\\
$|3|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (3,10)}{3} ={\frac{30}{3}} = 10$\\\\
$|4|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (4,10)}{4} ={\frac{20}{4}} = 5$\\\\
$|5|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (5,10)}{5} ={\frac{10}{5}} = 2$\\\\
$|6|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (6,10)}{6} ={\frac{30}{6}} = 5$\\\\
$|7|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (7,10)}{7} ={\frac{70}{7}} = 10$\\\\
$|8|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (8,10)}{8} ={\frac{40}{8}} = 5$\\\\
$|9|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (9,10)}{9} ={\frac{90}{9}} = 10$\\\\
Thus we have found the fewest steps.\\\\
If the element and addition modulo is relatively prime to $Z_n$,then that element's order is $n$\\\\
\section{The Generalization form}
\subsection{Theorem}
Under addition modulo $Z_n$, the order of an element in a group is for each element to take the least number of steps to go to the identity residue class which is $[0]$.The order of element $a$ in $Z_n$ is  ${\frac{l.c.m(a,n)}{a}}$ where $0<a\le n-1$.\\\

\subsubsection{Proof}
Let's take the addition modulo $Z_n$ and its residue classes are $Z_{n}$=$\{[0],[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],....,[n-1]\}$ \\\\
and order of each element under $Z_n$ is $Z_n =\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.....,(n-1)\}$\\\\
Here,the identity for the addition modulo is residue class $[0]$ and the element $0$ is already in the residue class $1$ so the order is $1$ but for n $\geq 0$ the order of that element\\\\

Now lets,take $Z_2$ so here the residue class are =$\{[0],[1]\}$ and the elements are $Z_2$=$\{0,1\}$\\\\


so the order of $0$ is $1$\\\\
the order of $1$ is\\\\
$|1|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (1,2)}{1} = 2$\\\\

$|1|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (1,k+1)}{1}  $\\\\
$|2|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (2,k+1)}{2}  $\\\\
$|3|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (3,k+1)}{3}  $\\\\
$|4|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (4,k+1)}{4}  $\\\\
$|5|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (5,k+1)}{5}  $\\\\

$|k-1|$ = $\frac{l.c.m (k-1,k+1)}{k-1}   $\\\\
$|k|$        = $\frac{l.c.m (k,k+1)}{k} $\\\\
The order of $|0|$ is always $1$\\\
Here,We can clearly see the $k$ and $(k+1)$ are two consecutive numbers so they are co-primes,so $k^{th}$ order is always $(k+1)$.Hence this is true for any numbers.\\\
The order of element $a$ in $Z_n$ is  ${\frac{l.c.m(a,n)}{a}}$ where $0<a\le n-1$.
\subsubsection{Corollary}
We can clearly see that the order of $|0|$ is always $1$ in this situation.\\
and when the element number $a$ and the number addition modulo $Z_n$ is relative prime then the order is $n$.and Any two consecutive integers or numbers will always be Co-Prime numbers since the successive numbers’ GCD will be always $1$. Example: $\{1,2\}, \{2,3\}, \{3,4\}, \{4,5\}, \{5,6\}$ and so on.So it is true for $Z_k$.
\section{The Code}
\subsection{The process}
We use Visual Studio Code as a compiler and for coding environment we choose python 3.14 version to produce the code.here we attach a picture of it and its true for any number in addition modulo of $Z_n$.This is for local computer version here the output will save into the local folder.We can see the output in a text file.\\\\
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{abcd.png}\\\
If the order of the elements are repeating we can conclude that the $Z_n$ where n is any prime number.\\\

This code is for any $k_{th}$ element's order where $k\geq1$.


\section{Conclusion}
We use multiple number theory concepts to solve the order of an element in a group under addition modulo, and this gives us another way to determine whether a number is prime or not.To observe modular arithmetic, we use a wheel setup..This is The Generalization form of order of an
element in a group under addition
modulo.
